# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a particular vertex to any other in the graph data structure. The project involves the use of adjacency list data structures implemented with a vector of nodes linked in lists, stacks, maps and vector of map entrees (pairs), highly effective data structures in terms of performance. The program implements higher-order abstract data structures, and object-oriented design principles.
